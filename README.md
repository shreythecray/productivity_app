# Working with GitHub through Terminal Commands

Clone this repo with the `clone` command:
```bash
git clone "[url]"
//replace [url] with the url of this repo or any other
```

Whenever someone makes changes to the remote repo, make sure to update your code with the `pull` command:
```
git pull
```

When working with branches:
1. use the `branch` command to list all branches and check which one you're on
2. use the `checkout` command to switch into a different, existing branch
3. use the `checkout -b` command to create a new branch and switch into it
```
git branch
git checkout [existing_branch_name]
git checkout -b "[new_branch_name]"
```

And my favoriate trio:
```
git add .
git commit -m "[message_about_your_changes]"
git push
```
